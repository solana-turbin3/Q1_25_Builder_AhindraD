**Letter of Intent (LOI)**

### I. Project Overview

- **Capstone Project Name/Idea:**\
  PrismPapers: The Transparent Research Publishing and Reviewing Platform.
  [PrismPapers - Teaser](https://ai.invideo.io/watch/eWg44dhBM4n)

- **Brief Project Description:**\
  PrismPapers is a blockchain-based platform designed to shake things up in academic publishing. With PrismPapers, researchers can submit their papers, get them reviewed transparently, and publish them in an open-access model. Powered by Solana’s fast and low-cost blockchain, the platform rewards reviewers with tokens ensures fair and timely feedback, and lets authors keep full copyright while monetizing their work. Researchers can earn income through tokenized access or optional donations, where institutions or individuals purchase access to specific research papers. The platform also incentivizes honest and high-quality reviews through a reputation system, where reviewers who provide constructive and timely feedback are rewarded more generously. Institutions play a crucial role by purchasing access to research on behalf of their researchers and students, supporting their academics’ publishing efforts, and integrating the platform into their research dissemination systems. It’s all about making science faster, fairer, and more rewarding!

- **Reason for Choosing this Project:**\
  Traditional academic publishing takes forever, costs too much, and is often opaque. PrismPapers is my way of fixing this mess. With blockchain, we can make the whole process speedy, transparent, and rewarding for everyone involved. Plus, I’m a tech geek who loves using blockchain to solve real-world problems.

### II. Go-to-Market Strategy

  - **For Researchers:** Easy publishing, complete copyright control, and income through tokenized access or donations.
  - **For Reviewers:** Tokens for timely, quality feedback and a clear track record of contributions, with higher rewards for honest, constructive reviews.
  - **For Institutions:** Affordable access to a vast repository of valuable research papers, support for their researchers’ publishing efforts, and integration of PrismPapers into their academic services.
  - **For Readers:** Affordable, direct access to valuable research papers without traditional paywalls.

- **Marketing and Distribution:**

  - Partnerships with universities and blockchain organizations.
  - Social media outreach on platforms like LinkedIn, ResearchGate, and Twitter.
  - Hosting webinars and writing blogs to spread the word about decentralized publishing.
  - Attending academic and blockchain events to showcase PrismPapers.

- **Competitive Landscape:**\
  What makes PrismPapers special?

  - Solana’s fast, low-cost blockchain keeps things scalable.
  - Tokenized peer reviews make feedback better and quicker.
  - Transparent and tamper-proof reviews build trust.
  - A reputation-based reward system ensures honest and high-quality reviews.
  - Institutions gain access to a cost-effective, open-access research platform that enhances academic transparency.
  - Open-access publishing with optional monetization puts power back in researchers’ hands.

### III. Technical Details

- **Tech Stack:**

  - **Blockchain Platform:** Solana
  - **Smart Contract Framework:** Anchor for developing Solana programs
  - **Front-End Framework:** Next.js
  - **Decentralized Storage:** IPFS/Arweave for storing encoded/hashed papers.
  - **Testing and Security:** Trident framework from Ackee Blockchain Security for unit tests and fuzzing

- **Smart Contract Development:**

  - Writing smart contracts using Anchor Framework.
  - Testing with TS unit tests and fuzzing with Trident to make sure everything runs smoothly.
  - Focusing on speed, security, and reliability for all interactions.

### IV. Conclusion

- **Project Timeline:**

- **Solana Program Development & Testing:**
  - Completed the development of the Solana program.
  - Successfully executed integration tests.
  - Deployed to devnet (see deployed program on [Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/address/5MRvAZkDQK1u27EEzrdpKS6uUKsGqEPRkztZVapcTcLv?cluster=devnet)).

- **Frontend Development:**
  - Currently building the platform’s front-end using Next.js.
  - Integrating asynchronous encryption to protect content before deployment.

- **Mainnet Launch Preparation:**
  - Finalize frontend integration with the Solana program.
  - Deploy to Solana mainnet alongside the fully functional frontend.
  - Target launch date: May 12, 2025.

- **Post-Launch Goals:**
  - Onboard initial users (researchers, reviewers, and institutions) and track engagement.
  - Collect user feedback for continuous improvements.
  - Monitor key performance indicators (e.g., active monthly users, engagement rates) and iterate based on results.


- **Primary Key Performance Indicator:**\
  For PrismPapers, the primary KPI will be **active monthly users (AMUs)**—a combined count of researchers, reviewers, and institutional users actively engaging       with the platform. Success will be defined as reaching **1,000 AMUs within the first six months** after launch, coupled with a robust engagement rate (e.g., at     least two completed peer reviews per paper submission). This metric not only gauges user adoption but also reflects the platform’s effectiveness in fostering a     lively, transparent, and value-driven academic community.


- **Commitment:**\
  I’m all in on making PrismPapers happen! This project isn’t just about tech; it’s about creating a better, faster, and more open way for researchers to share their work. Make R&D Great Again!


- **Initials:**\
  A.D.
