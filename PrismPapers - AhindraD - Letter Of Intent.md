**Letter of Intent (LOI)**

### I. Project Overview

- **Capstone Project Name/Idea:**\
  PrismPapers: The Transparent Research Publishing and Reviewing Platform.
  [PrismPapers - Teaser](https://ai.invideo.io/watch/eWg44dhBM4n)

- **Brief Project Description:**\
  PrismPapers is a blockchain-based platform designed to shake things up in academic publishing. With PrismPapers, researchers can submit their papers, get them reviewed transparently, and publish them in an open-access model. Powered by Solana’s fast and low-cost blockchain, the platform rewards reviewers with tokens ensures fair and timely feedback, and lets authors keep full copyright while monetizing their work. Researchers can earn income through tokenized access or optional donations, where institutions or individuals purchase access to specific research papers. The platform also incentivizes honest and high-quality reviews through a reputation system, where reviewers who provide constructive and timely feedback are rewarded more generously. Institutions play a crucial role by purchasing access to research on behalf of their researchers and students, supporting their academics’ publishing efforts, and integrating the platform into their research dissemination systems. It’s all about making science faster, fairer, and more rewarding!

- **Reason for Choosing this Project:**\
  Traditional academic publishing takes forever, costs too much, and is often opaque. PrismPapers is my way of fixing this mess. With blockchain, we can make the whole process speedy, transparent, and rewarding for everyone involved. Plus, I’m a tech geek who loves using blockchain to solve real-world problems.
